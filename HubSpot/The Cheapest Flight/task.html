<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p><i>"We need to fly home as cheaply as possible so that more money is left for gifts. Aunt Lidia asked for different kinds of cheeses, and Vasya wanted a new toy car. I’ve been looking at the schedule for quite a while and I’m starting to think that some planes are flying in vain".</i></p>

<p>As the input you get the flight schedule as an array, each element of which is the price of a direct flight between 2 cities (an array of 3 elements - 2 city names as a string, and a flight price).</p>

<p>Planes fly in both directions and the price in both directions is the same. There is a possibility that there are no direct flights between cities.</p>

<p>Find the price of the cheapest flight between cities that are given as the 2nd and 3rd arguments.</p>

<!-- Explain input and output values -->
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> 3 arguments: the flight schedule as an array of arrays, city of departure and destination city.
 </p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> Int. The best price.
