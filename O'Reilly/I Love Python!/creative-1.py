In my wildest dreams, I never imagined I'd have to write _essays_ here
on CheckiO. Yes, I know: who's talking? Really, I've written many mind-boggling
things here already, and I have puzzled many folks reading my solutions.
It's only fair that I puzzle myself now. :-\
So, what to write? You have already seen enough to realize that I consider
Python one of the most excellent inventions our civilization has ever made, not
only in the tier of programming languages. It still puzzles you: why one would
think so? Puzzling is good, because in this jaded culture, it is one of the
rare ways ideas can still be learned. Of course, my essay won't magically
enlighten you. But neither will Zen of Python by itself. Those are only small
chunks of an infinitely rich mosaic that's waiting for you to discover it on
your terms...
While you are trying to "digest" this essay, and wondering if it is an
essay at all, think: we must know, we will know. Good luck!"""[::73])
