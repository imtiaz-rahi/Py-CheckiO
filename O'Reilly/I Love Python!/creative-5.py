 Mein (*cough*) Star Wars

 About one and half months ago, in January 2015, I was looking for a "second" 
 programming language to learn that would give me a chance to search good 
 projects on a frilance board. My office (outrageous lie, I have no office)
 would be closed, but I had a home computer (it is my actual office), 
 a cap with ear-flaps, vodka, balalaika, and a tame bear, Bobik. I decided 
 to forget anything I know about PHP and use only the new scripting language 
 I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal 
 to Unix/C hackers (I'm not a hacker, of course, I even ask my grandmother 
 to power on my computer, it is very complicated task for me). I choose 
 Python as a search phrase for Google, being in a slightly irreverent mood 
 (as always, after one bottle of vodka).
 
 Today, I can safely say that Python has changed my life. I have moved my computer
 to a different room. I spend my working days meeting the challenges here on 
 CheckIO, when I'm not persuade my grandmother to power on the computer or spamming
 veky's solutions to attract any attention. There are Python labels on the cap 
 with ear-flaps, on the empty bottle of vodka, on the balalaika, and now on 
 the Bobik's back. Frankly, my only unfulfilled wish is to have at least one 
 contract invitation which is belongs to Python (also, Dear Santa, I want to earn 
 at least $500,000 per year without doing anything but Python programming, brand 
 new balalaika, drums, Mac Pro, and I want move myself and my grandmother (she 
 will help me to power on my brand new Mac Pro) to Thailand).
 
 Out of kidding, I'd like to say thank you Guido for this awesome language 
 he created. Another praise is to CheckIO team, which are created such a lovely
 place for learning Python. Another one is to all CheckIO members who are 
 speeding up my brain with their solutions.
