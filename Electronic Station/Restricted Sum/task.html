    Our new calculator is censored and as such it does not accept certain words.
    You should try to trick by writing a program to calculate the sum of numbers.
</p>

<p>
    Given a list of numbers, you should find the sum of these numbers.
    Your solution should not contain any of the banned words, even as a part of another word.
</p>

<p>The list of banned words are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><em>sum</em></li>
    <li><em>import</em></li>
    <li><em>for</em></li>
    <li><em>while</em></li>
    <li><em>reduce</em></li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A list of numbers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The sum of numbers.
