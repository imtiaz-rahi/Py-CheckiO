<strong>Magician:</strong> John, I'm going to blow your mind with a simple magic trick. Choose five cards.<br>
<i>The magician turns around to see nothing.</i><br>
<strong>John:</strong> I just picked five cards.<br>
<strong>Magician:</strong> Bot will tell me four of them and I will guess the fifth one.<br>
<strong>Bot:</strong> Jack of diamonds, Ace of hearts, Queen of clubs, King of spades.<br>
<strong>Magician:</strong> I see red, yeah it's of diamonds... And it's not a face...
It's even pretty low... The three of diamonds, right?!<br>
<i>The magician quickly turns around to see John's face...</i><br>
<strong>John:</strong> No way!<br>
<strong>Magician:</strong> Told you!<br>
<strong>John:</strong> It was just luck, do it again!<br>
<strong>Magician:</strong> I can do it all day long, dummy.

<p>
Well, it's an automatic magic trick, that I will explain in a moment.
You will have to create two functions. A function named <code>bot</code> which will take five cards,
an integer and return four of them ; and a function named <code>magician</code> which will take four cards,
the same integer and return the fifth one.
</p>

<p>
The trick use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck">standard 52-card deck</a>.
Cards will be represented like <code class="r">'A ♥'</code>, <code class="r">'3 ♦'</code>, <code class="b">'K ♠'</code>, <code class="b">'Q ♣'</code>, <code class="r">'J ♦'</code>
(<code class="b">♣</code> for clubs, <code class="r">♦</code> for diamonds,
<code class="r">♥</code> for hearts, <code class="b">♠</code> for spades,
A for Ace, J for Jack, Q for Queen and K for King).<br>

We will soon need to compare cards. The deck order is
<code><code class="b">A ♣</code> < <code class="r">A ♦</code> < <code class="r">A ♥</code> < <code class="b">A ♠</code> < <code class="b">2 ♣</code> < <code>...</code></code>.
To compare two cards, look ranks <code>A < 2 < ... < 10 < J < Q < K</code>,
then suits <code><code class="b">♣</code> < <code class="r">♦</code> < <code class="r">♥</code> < <code class="b">♠</code></code>
(same order than with letters: <code>club < diamond < heart < spade</code>).
</p>

<p>
The card the bot choose to hide and the order of the four cards the bot says is crucial for the magician
so he can guess the fifth one. There are five cards, but only four suits so there are at least two cards
from the same suit, we name them <i>card A</i> and <i>card B</i>. The bot will hide one and say the other,
but which one? Imagine the thirteen cards in a circle, <strong>clockwise</strong>.
If going from <i>card A</i> to <i>card B</i> on this circle is quicker than going from <i>card B</i> to <i>card A</i>,
then we will hide <i>card B</i>, say <i>card A</i>, and the distance from <i>card A</i> to <i>card B</i>
is noted as delta (it's necessarily a number between one and six). We still have three cards to say,
and since there are six ways to tell three cards, we can transmit "delta information".
The <i>card A</i> will be the starting point, then by "adding" delta to <i>card A</i>,
the magician can "guess" the fifth card.<br>

Sort the three remaining cards, according to the above order, and note them <i>C1</i>, <i>C2</i> and <i>C3</i>.
If delta is 5 or 6, put <i>C1</i> first, if delta is 3 or 4, put <i>C2</i> first, and <i>C3</i> otherwise.
You still have two cards to say, tell them in order if delta is odd (1, 3, 5), and in reverse order otherwise (2, 4, 6).<br>

At this point, the bot have two things to say: the <i>card A</i>, and a list of three cards.
If we repeat this magic trick multiple times and if we always say the <i>card A</i> first,
John might notice it since the fifth card and <i>card A</i> have the same suit.
So we are not going to always tell <i>card A</i> first. The first time, we will say it first,
the second time, say it second, ..., the fifth time, say it first again...

<strong>Example:</strong> John chooses
<code class="r">A ♥</code>, <code class="r">3 ♦</code>, <code class="b">K ♠</code>, <code class="b">Q ♣</code> and <code class="r">J ♦</code>.
<ul>
    <li>
        <code class="r">3 ♦</code> and <code class="r">J ♦</code> have the same suit, it's quicker to go from
        <code class="r">J ♦</code> to <code class="r">3 ♦</code> (<i>delta = 5</i>) than otherwise (8).
        The <i>starting point</i> is <code class="r">J ♦</code> and we <i>hide</i> <code class="r">3 ♦</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remains <code class="r">A ♥</code>, <code class="b">K ♠</code> and <code class="b">Q ♣</code>.
        Sorted, it's <code class="r">A ♥</code>, <code class="b">Q ♣</code> and <code class="b">K ♠</code>.
        delta = 5 so C1 = <code class="r">A ♥</code> first, 5 is odd so the other two in order.
        So <code class="r">A ♥</code>, <code class="b">Q ♣</code> and <code class="b">K ♠</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Since it's the first time we do the magic trick, then the bot says
        <code class="r">J ♦</code> first, then <code class="r">A ♥</code>, <code class="b">Q ♣</code> and <code class="b">K ♠</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The magician hears <code class="r">J ♦</code>, <code class="r">A ♥</code>, <code class="b">Q ♣</code> and <code class="b">K ♠</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        It's the first time he does the magic trick so <code class="r">J ♦</code> is the starting point. He can say it's of diamonds.
    </li>
    <li>
        From <code class="r">A ♥</code>, <code class="b">Q ♣</code>, <code class="b">K ♠</code> order, he deduces <i>delta = 5</i>
        (since <code class="r">A ♥</code> < <code class="b">Q ♣</code> < <code class="b">K ♠</code>).
        So <code><code class="r">J ♦</code> + 5 == <code class="r">3 ♦</code></code>.
        He says it, with some show.
    </li>
</ul>
