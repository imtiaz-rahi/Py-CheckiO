    During their adventure, the Robo-trio came across a desert, and the ships sensors have registered ore in the region.
    The desert has a size of <strong>10x10</strong> cells and can be represented as a 2D array.
    The ship has <strong>four</strong> probes which can be used to help us find the ore.
    At each step you will need to return the coordinates of a cell (as [row, column]) for the probe to travel to. 
    If the cell contains ore, then you can finish;
    else the probe will give a distance to the location of the ore cell
    (it will be the Euclidean distance between cells' centers).
    The perception of probe is not very good and it will give you a result rounded to the closest integer (1.41 ≈ 1; 2.83 ≈ 3).
    At each step you receive information from the previous probes as a list of list.
    Each list will be in the following format: [row, column, distance].
    At the beginning of the mission, you will only receive an empty list.

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The coordinate of the next probe as a list of two integers.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This task illustrates trilateration.
    Trilateration is the process of determining absolute or relative locations of points by measurement of distances,
    using the geometry of circles, spheres or triangles. In addition to being an interesting geometric problem,
    trilateration does have practical applications in surveying and navigation and is an important part of the equations making global positioning systems (GPS) possible.

    <strong>Precondition: </strong><br>
    len(desert) == 10<br>
    all(len(row) == 10 for row in desert)<br>
    There is always exist an ore cell in the desert.
