    8 puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of randomly ordered,
    numbered square tiles with one missing tile. The object of the puzzle is to
    place the tiles in the right order (see picture) by using sliding moves to utilize the
    empty space.

<p>
    Our puzzle is presented as a 3x3 matrix with numbers from 1 to 8. Zero is the
    empty cell. You can "move" the empty cell in four directions: up--"U",
    down--"D", left--"L", and right--"R". You need to return a sequence of moves
    to solve the puzzle. The solution is presented as string of symbols ("UDLR")
    describing your moves.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    The most obvious usage for the concepts in this task lie in creating a bot to solve slide puzzles;
    however, this task also is a fun way to learn something new because the n-puzzle is a classical problem for modeling algorithms involving heuristics.
