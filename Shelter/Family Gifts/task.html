<p>
    Every Christmas in my family, each of us gives a present to only one other person.
    To organize who should offer a gift to whom (I call it the chain of presents),
    we introduced a few rules:</p>
<p>
    - There should be a single chain where every person in the family is present,<br>
    - Couples should not give to one another,<br>
    - Every person should give a gift to a different person than they had in previous years
</p>
<p>
    So the problem would be to find and list the longest list of chains of presents.
    For example in a family {a,b,c,d} with couples=({a,b},{c,d}): [[a,c,b,d],[a,d,b,c]].
</p>

<p>
    You are given a set of family member names and a list of couples in this family.
    Find the maximum number of chains with all family members.
    Gift chains should be represented as a list of names where <b>i</b>-th gives a
    present to <b>i+1</b>-th and the last person in the list to the first.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Names of family members as a set of strings.
    Couple list as a tuple of sets with two strings in each.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The longest list of gift chains as a list/tuple of
    lists/tuples with strings.

<textarea data-code="python">
find_chains({'Gary', 'Jeanette', 'Hollie'}, ({'Gary', 'Jeanette'},)) # 0 chains

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    This is a combinatorial task that can be useful for scheduling.

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
</p>
<pre>
len(couples) <= 7
