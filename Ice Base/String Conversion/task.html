<p> - Oh. This new generation of robots is trying to do everything faster than is needed.</p>
<p> - Come on!! Gaffer! Can I just replace a string and that's all.</p>
<p> - No, young man. You can’t “just replace a string”. You should respect your memory cards, even though you have a lot of them. Now sit and think a little bit. How can this string can be replaced in a most efficient way?</p>
<p> - Ok ok. As you wish. Now I should respect even my own hardware.</p>

    You are given two strings, line1 and line2. Answer, what is the smallest number of operations you need to transform line1 to line2?

</p>

<p>Operations are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Delete one letter from one of strings</li>
	<li>Insert one letter into one of strings</li>
	<li>Replace one of letters from one of strings with another letter</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Input: </strong>two arguments, two strings.</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>int, minimum number of operations.</p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre class="brush: python">
steps_to_convert('line1', 'line1') == 0
steps_to_convert('line1', 'line2') == 1
steps_to_convert('ine', 'line2') == 2
</pre>
