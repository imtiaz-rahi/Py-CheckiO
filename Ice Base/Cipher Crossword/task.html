    Everyone has tried solving a crossword puzzle at some point in their lives. 
    We're going to mix things up by adding a cipher to the classic puzzle.
    A cipher crossword replaces the clues for each entry with clues for each white cell of the grid. 
    These clues are integers ranging from 1 to 26, inclusive. 
    The objective, as any other crossword, is to determine the proper letter for each cell.
    In a cipher crossword, the 26 numbers serve as a cipher for those letters: cells that share matching numbers are filled
    with matching letters, and no two numbers stand for the same letter. All resulting entries must be valid words.
</p>

<p>
    For this task you should solve the cipher crossword. You are given a crossword template as a list of lists (2D array)
    with numbers (from 0 to 26), where <strong>0</strong> is a blank cell and other numbers are encrypted letters.
    You will be given a list of words for the crossword puzzle. You should fill that template with a given word and return
    the solved crossword as a list of lists with letters. Blank cells are replaced with whitespaces (0 => " ").
</p>

<p>
    The words are placed in rows and columns with NO diagonals.
    The crossword contains six words with 5 letters each. These words are placed in a grid.

    <strong>How it is used:</strong>
    This is a type of restriction problem.
    You have rules and should try to find a combination that conforms to these rules.
    This concept can help you to solve scheduling conflicts and - a situation where you would encounter many variables
    and restrictions, among other things.
